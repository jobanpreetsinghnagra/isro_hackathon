Chain of Thought(CoT)
Large language models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning
steps. Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.

Geo Spatial Data
Geospatial data is information that describes objects, events or other features with a location on or near the surface of the earth.

GIS 
Geospatial information systems (GIS) relate specifically to the physical mapping of data within a visual representation.
For example, when a hurricane map (which shows location and time) is overlaid with another layer showing potential areas for
lightning strikes, you’re seeing GIS in action.

Types of geospatial data

Geospatial data is information recorded with a geographic indicator of some type.
There are two primary forms of geospatial data: vector data and raster data.

Vector data is data in which points, lines and polygons represent features such as properties, cities,
roads, mountains and bodies of water. For example, a visual representation that uses vector data might include houses
represented by points, roads represented by lines and entire towns represented by polygons.

Raster data is pixelated or gridded cells identified according to row and column.
Raster data creates imagery that’s substantially more complex, such as photographs and satellite images.
